The idea combined real-world medical need with technical feasibility, making it an ideal choice for both the competition and future development.</p> <p>The initial phase focused on classification. A compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed using TensorFlow and Keras.

Despite this, access to reliable and early diagnosis remains a challenge for millions of people. In many parts of the world \u2014 particularly in low-resource or rural areas \u2014 individuals do not have easy access to dermatologists or specialized skin care facilities. This lack of access often leads to delayed diagnosis, self-medication, or no treatment at all, which can worsen otherwise manageable conditions.</p> <p>With the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, there is potential to bridge this gap. However, most existing AI-powered medical assistants focus exclusively on either textual symptom checkers or basic image classification tools. These solutions, while promising, are often too narrow in scope and fall short in terms of real-world usability and reliability.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/MedAI/01_problem_statement/#key-challenges-in-current-solutions","title":"Key Challenges in Current Solutions","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Limited Modality Support    Most chatbot-based assistants accept only text input.

For example, users may upload blurry photos, pictures of objects, or unrelated content \u2014 and the model proceeds to give a diagnosis anyway. This introduces serious risks in interpretation and undermines the tool's credibility.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disjointed Experience    Many systems isolate different functionalities.
