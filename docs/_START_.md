# 📘 Project Documentation: Getting Started

---

## ✨ Why Document My Projects?

- Helps me **track progress** over time.
- Improves **clarity of thought** while working through problems.
- Records my **mistakes and fixes**, avoiding repetition.
- Becomes a personal **knowledge base** and portfolio.
- Useful for sharing with mentors, teammates, or job interviews.

## 🛠️ How I Plan to Document Everything

I’ll use **Markdown (.md)** for all documentation.  
Each project will have its own folder with the following files:

```bash
MyProject/
├── _start_.md               <- This file (how & why)
├── README.md                <- Summary of the project
├── 01_problem_statement.md  <- What's the problem?
├── 02_thinking_and_approach.md
├── 03_data_pipeline.md
├── 04_model_architecture.md
├── 05_training_logs.md
├── 06_issues_and_solutions.md
├── 07_results_and_visuals.md
├── 08_learnings.md
└── 09_future_work.md
```
