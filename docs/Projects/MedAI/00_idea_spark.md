# ðŸ’¡ Idea Spark

The concept for **MedAI** originated as part of a university assignment from my Natural Language Processing (NLP) professor. The objective was to develop a **medical chatbot** that could accept **both text and image inputs** to assist users in a meaningful way.

While exploring possible use cases, I decided to focus on a specific healthcare domain â€” **skin diseases**. This decision came after researching online and recognizing the accessibility challenges people face when identifying early signs of skin conditions.

## Project Goals

Beyond fulfilling the assignment, I saw **MedAI** as an opportunity to challenge myself and apply the tools and frameworks Iâ€™ve been learning:

- **LangChain + Gemini** for intelligent, tool-augmented conversations
- **TensorFlow** for image-based condition prediction
- **Flask** to build a minimal yet functional web app
- **Firebase** for secure user authentication and data storage
- **Scikit-learn**, **Joblib**, and other supporting ML utilities

The real motivation was to **bring everything together** â€” from backend to ML to user interface â€” and build something practical and insightful.
