# Planning

The development of **ImgTechAI** was guided by a structured plan to ensure clarity of scope, feasibility, and alignment with the project’s objectives. The planning phase focused on identifying the core goals, defining the scope of features, and outlining the technical approach.

## Objectives

1. **Accessibility** – Provide a user-friendly interface for image processing that does not require programming knowledge.
2. **Comprehensiveness** – Integrate a wide range of image processing and computer vision techniques in one platform.
3. **Interactivity** – Enable real-time previews of transformations with adjustable parameters.
4. **Efficiency** – Optimize transformations to run smoothly in a browser environment.
5. **Educational Value** – Serve as a learning aid for students and practitioners exploring computer vision.

## Scope

* **In-Scope**

  * Core image processing techniques (filtering, segmentation, transformations, noise injection, etc.)
  * Intuitive parameter controls via Streamlit sidebar widgets
  * Real-time comparison of original and transformed images
  * Transformation summary and download functionality
  * Browser-based deployment (Streamlit Cloud or local hosting)

* **Out of Scope (Initial Release)**

  * Deep learning-based image transformations (GANs, style transfer, etc.)
  * Video processing or real-time webcam integration
  * Batch image processing pipelines

## Development Strategy

1. **Prototype Design**

   * Create a minimal Streamlit app with image upload and display.
   * Test integration of a few basic transformations.

2. **Feature Expansion**

   * Gradually add categories: segmentation, Fourier analysis, noise injection, histogram operations, etc.
   * Implement parameter tuning for each transformation.

3. **Optimization & UI Improvements**

   * Ensure smooth performance with medium-sized images.
   * Add image information display and transformation summary.

4. **Deployment & Testing**

   * Deploy on Streamlit Cloud for public accessibility.
   * Collect feedback for usability and feature requests.

## Milestones

* **M1**: Basic app with upload, display, and grayscale conversion.
* **M2**: Addition of segmentation and filtering techniques.
* **M3**: Fourier analysis, histogram operations, and augmentations.
* **M4**: Real-time side-by-side comparison and download functionality.
* **M5**: Deployment and documentation completion.
