# Problem Statement

Despite the rapid advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence, **practical accessibility to image processing tools remains limited** for a large segment of learners and practitioners. The existing landscape presents several challenges:

1. **High Entry Barrier**

   * Popular libraries such as OpenCV, scikit-image, and NumPy offer robust functionalities but require programming knowledge.
   * Non-programmers (students, designers, researchers from non-CS backgrounds) face difficulty experimenting with these techniques.

2. **Fragmented Ecosystem**

   * Image transformations are spread across multiple libraries, each with its own learning curve and setup requirements.
   * Beginners often struggle to integrate different functionalities into a cohesive workflow.

3. **Lack of Interactivity**

   * Most tutorials and tools are code-based, making it difficult to visualize the impact of parameter tuning in real time.
   * Experimentation becomes tedious without an immediate feedback loop.

4. **Limited Accessibility for Quick Prototyping**

   * Researchers and developers often need to rapidly prototype preprocessing pipelines.
   * Setting up environments and coding transformations from scratch slows down productivity.

5. **Educational Gaps**

   * Students learning computer vision concepts often lack intuitive platforms to connect theory with practical outcomes.
   * The absence of a no-code, interactive environment makes it harder to grasp concepts like Fourier transforms, edge detection, or histogram equalization.

## Core Problem

There is **no single, web-based, user-friendly platform** that consolidates a wide range of image processing techniques, provides **real-time visualization**, and supports **easy experimentation without coding**.

**ImgTechAI** addresses this gap by delivering a browser-based solution that unifies advanced image processing methods under one intuitive interface.
