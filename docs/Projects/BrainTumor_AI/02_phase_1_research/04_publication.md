## Abstract Overview

The paper addresses the growing need for early detection of brain tumors using AI-based solutions. Our CNN-based model processes MRI images and classifies them into four categories: **No Tumor**, **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, and **Pituitary Tumor**. The model stands out due to its compact size (\~39.5 MB) and impressive performance metrics:

* **Training Accuracy:** 99.20%
* **Validation Accuracy:** 97.68%
* **Testing Accuracy:** 97.10%

Such high accuracy with lightweight architecture makes it suitable for real-time, resource-constrained medical environments.
