# âœ¨ Key Features

The Brain Tumor Detection System is designed to deliver accurate, fast, and accessible diagnostic support using deep learning. Below are the core features that define its functionality and value.

---

## 1. MRI Image Validation

Before processing, the system checks whether the uploaded file is a valid brain MRI. This prevents misclassification caused by irrelevant or non-medical images.

* Uses a lightweight CNN classifier for validation.
* Alerts users if the image doesn't qualify for tumor detection.

---

## 2. Tumor Classification (Multi-Class)

The core classification model identifies the presence and type of brain tumor from MRI scans. It supports four categories:

* **No Tumor**
* **Glioma**
* **Meningioma**
* **Pituitary**

The model was trained on a balanced dataset and achieves high accuracy across all classes.

## 3. Tumor Segmentation

If a tumor is detected, a dedicated segmentation model highlights the affected region on the scan using colored overlays.

* Pixel-level segmentation with high precision.
* Enhances interpretability for both clinicians and students.

---

## 4. Auto-Generated Diagnostic Reports

Each prediction includes a downloadable report summarizing:

* Input validity
* Classification result
* Tumor overlay (if any)
* Timestamp and image references

This helps in documenting outcomes for further medical consultation or academic use.

## 5. Web-Based Interface

The complete system runs as a responsive web app built with Streamlit:

* No installation or technical setup required
* Mobile and desktop friendly
* Clean UI with real-time prediction flow

## 6. Educational & Research Focus

This project bridges research and real-world application:

* Originally developed for academic publication
* Now deployed for broader awareness and learning
* Backed by IEEE publication and open-source contributions
