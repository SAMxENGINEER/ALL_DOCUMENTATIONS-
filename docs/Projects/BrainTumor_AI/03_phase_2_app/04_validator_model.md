# 05 Validator Model ‚Äì Image Classification for Input Integrity

The Validator Model is a dedicated binary classifier designed to detect whether an input image is a **valid brain MRI** or an **invalid, unrelated image**. It serves as the **first checkpoint** in the Brain Tumor Detection System, ensuring that only relevant images proceed for tumor classification or segmentation.

---

## Model Purpose

The primary goal of the Validator Model is to:

* Prevent unrelated images (e.g., furniture, animals, chest X-rays) from being misinterpreted by the tumor detection system.
* Improve the robustness, accuracy, and trustworthiness of the pipeline.
* Simulate real-world use cases where users may accidentally upload non-brain images.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The model follows a custom-built **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with batch normalization, max-pooling, and dropout regularization. Below is a summary of its architecture:

## üß™ Dataset Composition

The final dataset used for training was constructed after aggregating multiple image sources, classified as **valid** or **invalid**.

### ‚úÖ Valid Images

All 5,712 valid images are sourced from the brain MRI tumor dataset's official training set, spanning 4 classes:

* Glioma
* Meningioma
* Pituitary
* No Tumor

### Invalid Images

Invalid images include both medical and non-medical data, collected across multiple curated sections:

| Section | Description                      | Count |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ----- |
| 1       | Furniture images                 | 400   |
| 2       | Animal images (90√ó10)            | 900   |
| 3       | Human portraits                  | 400   |
| 4       | Vehicles                         | 700   |
| 5       | Bone X-rays                      | 1,400 |
| 6       | Lung X-rays                      | 600   |
| 7       | Segmentation masks (X-ray scans) | 1,050 |

**Total Invalid Images**: 5,450

### üîÑ Final Class Distribution

| Class     | Count      |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Valid     | 5,712      |
| Invalid   | 5,450      |
| **Total** | **11,162** |

## üß† Why This Model Matters

This validator ensures the integrity of every input entering the brain tumor detection system. It acts as a **domain-aware filter**, improving downstream model accuracy and avoiding false classifications on completely unrelated data.
