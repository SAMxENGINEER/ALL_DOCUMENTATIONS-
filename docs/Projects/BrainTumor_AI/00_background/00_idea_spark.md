# 00 â€“ Idea Spark ðŸ’¡

The foundation of this project was laid during a college-level **technical writing competition**, where the objective was to present a meaningful application of technology backed by solid documentation. During early brainstorming sessions, a discussion with a close friendâ€”an epidemiology postgraduateâ€”sparked the idea of applying deep learning to **brain tumor detection**. 

Brain tumors can lead to a wide range of serious health issuesâ€”chronic headaches, seizures, memory loss, speech difficulties, and in severe cases, paralysis. Early detection is crucial, often determining both the effectiveness of treatment and the patientâ€™s long-term outcome. However, access to timely diagnosis is often limited, especially in under-resourced healthcare environments.

This challenge presented an opportunity: to build an **AI-powered system** capable of assisting in the **preliminary detection of brain tumors** using MRI scans. The idea combined real-world medical need with technical feasibility, making it an ideal choice for both the competition and future development.

The initial phase focused on classification. A compact **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was developed using TensorFlow and Keras. Trained on publicly available brain MRI datasets, the model demonstrated strong performance:

* **Training Accuracy**: 99.20%
* **Validation Accuracy**: 97.68%
* **Testing Accuracy**: 97.10%
* **Model Size**: 39.5 MB

The model could classify MRI images into four categories:

* **No Tumor**
* **Glioma**
* **Meningioma**
* **Pituitary**

What started as a simple prototype quickly gained momentum. With faculty mentorship, the work was formalized into a research paper and submitted to an IEEE conferenceâ€”where it was accepted and published. ðŸ“„

This early recognition validated the direction of the project and laid the groundwork for **Phase 2**: transforming the research into a fully functional application with real-time inference, tumor segmentation, and a user-friendly web interface.
