## Phase 1: Research and Model Development

This foundational phase established the technical groundwork for the project.

### Key Activities:

* **Dataset Curation**: Curated high-quality brain MRI scans from publicly available sources, ensuring diversity across tumor types.
* **Image Preprocessing**: Standardized inputs via grayscale conversion, cropping, resizing, and Gaussian filtering to enhance consistency.
* **Feature Engineering**: Employed histogram-based methods and complementary techniques to optimize data for classification tasks.
* **Model Development**: Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain tumors into four categories: *No Tumor, Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary*.
* **Performance Evaluation**: Achieved a test accuracy exceeding 97%, confirming the model’s diagnostic reliability.
