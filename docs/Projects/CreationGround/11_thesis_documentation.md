## 1. Title

**Creation Ground: Experiment, Create and Learn ML**

---

## 2. Abstract

This thesis presents **Creation Ground**, a no-code, interactive platform designed to enable users without deep technical expertise to build, train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models.  
The platform focuses on **flexibility**, **customization**, and **transparency**, providing users with full control over the ML pipeline while maintaining an intuitive interface.

The system was developed as part of a **minor project** in the 6th semester, successfully deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**, and filed for **patent**.

## 3. Key Objectives

1. **Simplify** the ML workflow for non-technical users.
2. **Empower** users with control over each stage of model creation.
3. Provide a **sandbox environment** similar to creative games, where experimentation is encouraged.
4. Ensure the platform supports **varied datasets** and problem types.
5. Offer **deployment-ready** models for real-world integration.

## 4. Research Methodology

The methodology followed:

1. **Conceptualization** â€“ Originated during the Diwali break and validated through a single-page prototype.
2. **Requirement Analysis** â€“ Focused on features not offered by tools like Teachable Machine.
3. **Design & Development** â€“ Built using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn with modular design.
4. **Testing & Evaluation** â€“ Models tested across classification and regression datasets.
5. **Deployment** â€“ Hosted on Streamlit Cloud and Render.
6. **Documentation & Filing** â€“ Complete thesis written and patent filed.

## 5. Achievements

- Successfully implemented an **end-to-end ML model creation platform**.
- Deployment across **multiple environments**.
- Filed for **patent** based on novelty.
- Generated a complete **user-friendly documentation**.
