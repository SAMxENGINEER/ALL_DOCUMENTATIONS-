# Features

## Overview

**Creation Ground** provides a **complete, end-to-end environment** for building machine learning models — combining **ease of use**, **deep customization**, and **full transparency**.

The platform is organized into modular sections, each dedicated to a stage in the ML pipeline, from **dataset upload** to **model export**.

---

## 1. Dataset Upload & Management

* Upload datasets in **CSV** or **Excel** format.
* Automatic file validation with clear error messages for incompatible formats.
* Instant dataset preview with row and column summaries.
* Option to replace or update datasets without restarting the workflow.

---

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* View dataset shape, missing value counts, and data types at a glance.
* Built-in visualizations:

  * Histograms
  * Scatter plots
  * Correlation heatmaps
* Quick-access summary statistics for immediate insights.

---

## 3. Data Preprocessing Tools

* **Missing value handling** — drop rows/columns or impute values.
* **Encoding** — label encoding and one-hot encoding.
* **Scaling** — standardization and normalization.
* **Dimensionality reduction** — PCA.
* **Feature selection** — remove low-variance features.

---

## 4. Problem Type Selection

* Choose between **Classification** and **Regression** workflows.
* Guided prompts help ensure the correct problem type is selected.

---

## 5. Algorithm Library

A versatile selection of algorithms from **scikit-learn**, including:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machine
* Gradient Boosting
* Linear Regression
* Ridge & Lasso Regression
  Each algorithm is accompanied by **in-app descriptions** for quick reference.

---

## 6. Hyperparameter Tuning

* Algorithm-specific parameter fields with real-time validation.
* Beginner-friendly defaults plus advanced options for fine-tuning.

---

## 7. Model Training & Evaluation

* Single-click training for the chosen algorithm(s).
* Metrics:

    * **Classification** — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
    * **Regression** — MAE, MSE, R²
  
* Visual tools: confusion matrix, ROC curves, and comparison charts.
* Side-by-side performance comparisons across multiple models.

---

## 8. Model Export

* Download trained models in `.joblib` format.
* Export preprocessing pipelines for consistent data handling.
* Ready for integration into Python scripts or other applications.

---

## 9. Learning Resources (ML Playbook)

* Integrated **ML Playbook** with curated educational content.
* Clear explanations of ML concepts, algorithms, and evaluation metrics.
* Designed to help beginners learn theory while applying it in practice.

---

## 10. User-Friendly Interface

* Developed with **Streamlit** for a responsive, interactive experience.
* Sidebar navigation for quick movement between modules.
* Clean, modern styling for a professional look and feel.

---

## Summary

**Creation Ground** is both a **practical ML workspace** and a **learning platform** — empowering users to build, customize, and export models while maintaining complete visibility into every step of the process.
