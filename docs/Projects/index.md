# Project Documentation: Getting Started

> **Welcome to my structured project documentation workspace.**  
> This isn't just a habit — it's a professional investment in how I learn, build, reflect, and grow as an engineer.

## Projects Overview

This is the **central hub** for all my documented projects. Each project page contains detailed notes on problem statements, technical decisions, implementations, and reflections.

### Active Projects

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **[BrainTumor AI](./BrainTumor_AI/index.md)** | Deep learning–based workflow for brain tumor classification and segmentation using MRI data | Deep Learning, Medical Imaging |
| **[CreationGround](./CreationGround/index.md)** | My experimental playground for testing new ML concepts, building prototypes, and refining workflows | ML, Prototyping |
| **[ExamPrompt AI](./ExamPrompt_AI/index.md)** | An intelligent exam-preparation assistant built with LangChain, Flask, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) | LangChain, Flask, RAG |
| **[Lung Cancer](./Lung_Cancer/index.md)** | Machine learning and deep learning approaches for early detection and classification of lung cancer | ML, DL, Medical AI |
| **[MedAI](./MedAI/index.md)** | A broader medical imaging initiative covering classification, validation, and segmentation models | Medical Imaging, AI |
| **[ImgTechAI](./ImgTechAI/index.md)** | A web-based image processing and computer vision application with real-time transformations and no-code interactivity | Streamlit, OpenCV, NumPy |

## Why I Document My Projects

Well-crafted documentation helps me in multiple ways:

### **Professionally**

- **Demonstrate clarity of thought** to employers and collaborators
- **Build a public portfolio** that tells the story behind my code
- **Prepare for technical interviews** with real-world examples
- **Showcase decision-making** and debugging processes

### **Personally**

- **Think through problems** more systematically
- **Avoid repeating past mistakes**
- **Recall important decisions** even months later
- **Track my progress** as a developer over time

## My Documentation Workflow

### **During Development**
• Start with a problem statement  
• Log decisions as I go  
• Capture screenshots or errors  
• Track feature progress and time spent  

### **After Completion**
• Polish the README  
• Write reflections, lessons, and challenges  
• Record a demo or create diagrams  
• Finalize documentation for deployment  

### **Monthly Maintenance**
• Update if project evolves  
• Fix broken links or typos  
• Revisit for portfolio enhancement

## Writing Guidelines

| **Avoid** | **Better** |
|-----------|------------|
| "Docker was crashing" | "The container failed due to exceeding Hugging Face's 512Mi memory limit" |
| Just stating *what* happened | Explaining *why* decisions were made |
| Hiding failures | Logging failures (they tell the real engineering story) |
| Text-only documentation | Using visuals: screenshots, flow diagrams, UI previews |
| Complex jargon | Writing like you're explaining to your future self |

## What Great Documentation Answers

1. **What problem did I solve?**  
2. **How did I solve it?**  
3. **What trade-offs or difficulties did I face?**  
4. **What results did I achieve?**  
5. **What did I learn?**
