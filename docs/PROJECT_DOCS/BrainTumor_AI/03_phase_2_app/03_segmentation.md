# 03 â€“ Tumor Segmentation

## Overview

After identifying the presence and type of brain tumor, the final and crucial phase of our diagnostic pipeline is **tumor segmentation**. This stage involves generating a **pixel-wise binary mask** that highlights the tumor region in an MRI scan. Unlike classification, which tells us *what* is present, segmentation informs us *where* the anomaly is located.

Segmentation is not just a cosmetic stepâ€”it enhances diagnostic interpretability, guides surgical planning, and provides quantifiable tumor boundaries.

## Importance of Tumor Segmentation

Accurate tumor segmentation plays a pivotal role in real-world medical applications:

* **Precision Localization**: Identifies exact tumor regions for surgical intervention
* **Quantitative Insights**: Enables tumor volume estimation and progression tracking
* **Clinical Interpretability**: Enhances radiologistsâ€™ understanding through visual outputs
* **Pipeline Synergy**: Feeds into hybrid workflows like 3D reconstructions or radiotherapy simulations

## Model Architecture

Our segmentation model is a **U-Net variant**, specifically adapted for brain MRI images. It performs binary classification on each pixel, labeling it as either tumor (`1`) or background (`0`).

## Post-Classification Integration

The segmentation module is **only triggered after** the image passes the classification pipeline and is labeled as a valid brain MRI. This conditional execution ensures computational efficiency and avoids unnecessary predictions on irrelevant or invalid input images.

## Summary

* The segmentation model uses a robust U-Net architecture for binary mask generation.
* Performs strongly with an F1 score of \~0.80 and IoU of \~0.72.
* Supports downstream applications via accurate tumor localization.
* Visualization outputs offer strong clinical interpretability.

This segmentation stage completes the intelligent imaging pipeline, bridging raw diagnostic input to structured, actionable output.
