# Brain Tumor Detection System

An end-to-end deep learning application for brain MRI validation, tumor classification, and tumor region segmentation â€” developed in two structured phases: research and deployment.

---

## Overview

The Brain Tumor Detection System is a deep learningâ€“based medical imaging tool designed to assist in the preliminary diagnosis of brain tumors using MRI scans. It performs three key tasks:

* Validates whether the uploaded image is a brain MRI.
* Classifies the image into one of four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or No Tumor.
* Segments and highlights the tumor region if present.
* Generates a downloadable diagnostic report summarizing predictions and overlays.

Initially developed as a research prototype for a technical writing competition, the project later evolved into a production-ready web application with robust architecture, improved models, and user-facing features.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 â€“ Research and Publication

* Built and evaluated the initial tumor classification model using TensorFlow and Keras on Google Colab.
* Drafted and submitted a technical research paper, which was later accepted for publication.
* Developed under the guidance of domain experts and academic mentors.

### Phase 2 â€“ Application Development and Deployment

* Introduced an MRI validator model to filter out irrelevant inputs.
* Improved the classification model and added a segmentation pipeline.
* Built a user interface using Streamlit for ease of access.
* Integrated auto-generated test reports with visual overlays.
* Deployed the complete system on Streamlit Cloud.

## Repository Structure

This project is distributed across two Git repositories:

1. **Frontend (Live Web App)** â€“ contains the minimal app code deployed on Streamlit.
2. **Main Repository (Complete Project)** â€“ includes all models, training notebooks, dataset preparation code, and documentation.

Due to deployment constraints and logical separation, we deviated from our standard monorepo structure. This has been clarified across the documentation files.
