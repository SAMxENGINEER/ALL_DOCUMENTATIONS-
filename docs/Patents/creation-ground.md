## üìù Abstract

**Creation Ground** is a no-code platform that simplifies **machine learning model development** for everyone ‚Äî including those with no programming experience.  

Users can:

- Upload datasets (CSV or Excel)
- Automatically preprocess and clean data
- Select and train the best machine learning models
- Optimize performance with built-in hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate results with easy-to-read reports
- Export trained models for use anywhere

The system is built using **Streamlit** for the interface and **Scikit-learn** for the backend ML operations.
