**Summary:**  
This work presents a CNN-based approach to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans into four categories: No tumor, Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary tumor. Achieved a training accuracy of 99.20% and testing accuracy of 97.10%. The research formed the foundation for further development of AI-driven diagnostic tools in healthcare.
