## Abstract

Brain tumors can cause severe health complications, including headaches, nausea, seizures, personality changes, and in some cases, paralysis or speech/vision problems. Early detection can significantly improve treatment effectiveness and patient survival.

This study presents a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for the classification of brain tumors using MRI scans. The model distinguishes between four classes: **No tumor**, **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, and **Pituitary tumor**.

Key performance metrics:

- Model size: 39.5 MB  
- Training accuracy: 99.20%  
- Validation accuracy: 97.68%  
- Testing accuracy: 97.10%  

MRI scans were selected due to their reliability and wide usage in medical imaging for brain tumor diagnosis.

## Connection to Larger Project

This publication is part of **Phase 1** of a broader AI-assisted medical imaging initiative.  

**Phase 1 objectives included:**

- Designing and implementing a high-performance CNN for brain tumor classification.
- Curating, cleaning, and preprocessing a high-quality MRI dataset.
- Conducting experiments to validate the model’s accuracy and robustness.

**Planned future phases will:**

- Deploy the model into real-time diagnostic systems for clinical use.
- Expand classification capabilities to include additional tumor types and medical imaging modalities.
