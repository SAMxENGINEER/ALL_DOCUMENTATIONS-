# Problem Statement

## Objective

The purpose of ExamPrompt AI is to streamline and personalize exam preparation by enabling users to upload a syllabus, textbook content, or question banks, and receive AI-generated questions, answers, or explanations that are contextually relevant.

---

## The Problem

- Traditional question-answering tools are often generic and not aligned with specific curricula.
- Students spend a significant amount of time filtering irrelevant content while preparing for exams.
- Educators often need to manually create diverse and targeted questions for each unit or subject.
- Existing tools typically lack the ability to process handwritten notes, scanned PDFs, or unstructured data formats.

## Importance

AI technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and large language models (LLMs) can enable smarter handling of educational content. Leveraging these technologies can:

- Make studying more efficient by aligning generated content with the actual syllabus.
- Improve accessibility by supporting multiple input types (PDF, image, text).
- Help educators save time and enhance the quality of assessments.

## Target Audience

- Students preparing for school or university exams
- Educators and tutors designing question sets or practice materials
- Developers or researchers exploring educational applications of OCR and LLMs

---

## Key Goals

- Accept syllabus or content input from various formats (PDF, image, text)
- Generate relevant questions or answers using LLMs like OpenAI via LangChain
- Enable lightweight interaction via a web interface
- Support long-term scalability for multi-subject and multi-language support
