# Origin of the Idea

## How It Started

This project was born out of a personal experience during recent academic exams. While preparing, I began using various AI tools to help me summarize topics, generate practice questions, and clarify concepts I was struggling with. What started as simple experimentation turned out to be extremely effective — it helped me study more efficiently and ultimately perform better.

## Realization

Through this process, I realized that many students could benefit from a similar system — something that bridges the gap between raw study material and targeted exam preparation using AI. The idea of building a tool that automates this process started taking shape: what if users could simply upload their syllabus or topic list and get back customized questions, answers, and summaries?

## From Use Case to Product

What I found most helpful:

- Generating custom questions from the syllabus
- Asking AI to explain topics in simpler terms
- Having summaries for quick revisions

That experience sparked the idea for **ExamPrompt AI** — a web application designed to help students prepare smarter by turning their own syllabus into interactive learning material.

This project is an attempt to turn a personal solution into a scalable tool that others can benefit from too.
